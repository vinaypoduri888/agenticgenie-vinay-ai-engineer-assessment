## Stage 0 — Audit & documentation (2026-10-31)

- **Task:** Inspect repo, read full assessment PDF (all 10 pages), create/update CLAUDE.md,
  docs/ASSESSMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md.
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Files changed:** `.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ASSESSMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`,
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` (this file), `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- **Findings:**
  - Repo had no git history (`git init` run, no commits yet). No application code exists.
  - Repo contained two local-only files besides the PDF brief: the assessment PDF itself and
    `ticketbooking.docx` — the candidate's own paraphrase/notes on the assessment, confirming the
    tech stack decision (Next.js/Express 5/Prisma/Postgres/Redis+BullMQ/Nemotron/Three.js) already
    matches the PDF's requirements. Both are gitignored (confidential / derived-from-confidential).
  - Tooling confirmed available locally: Node v20.17.0, npm 10.8.2, Docker 29.8.2,
    Docker Compose v5.6.0, PostgreSQL client 18.6, Git 2.55.0.
- **Tests executed:** None yet (no code).
- **Commit hash:** _pending — first commit will cover Stage 0 docs._
- **Remaining issues:** None blocking; awaiting approval to start Stage 1 (project foundation).
